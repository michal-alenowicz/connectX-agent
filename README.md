# connectX-agent
My agent from the ongoing kaggle ConnectX competition. When active, it hovers in the top 15-20% of the rolling leaderboard.
I used minimax search with alphaâ€“beta pruning, plus a pre-computed opening book (relatively shallow).
I experimented with various versions of heuristics, this one seems to work best for now.
It was a fun project; I will revisit it to enhance the algorithm and refactor the code in future.


## An example ConnectX game played by my agent (blue pieces) on kaggle:
